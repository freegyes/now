# /now

**The /now page lists the projects I'm currently working on.**

## Projects
At this point in my life I am focused on these projects (in no particular order):

## About the /now page
The /now page is a reminder for myself when I'm feeling unfocused. A declaration of priorities. If I dedicate a significant amount of my resources to anything that is not listed here, I step back and ask myself if that thing should be listed here or dropped.
