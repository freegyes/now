# /now

**The /now page<sup>[1](#footnote-01)</sup> lists the projects I'm currently working on.**

## Projects
At this point in my life I am focused on these projects (in no particular order):
  - [CodeBerry](https://codeberryschool.com/). selling top talents and writing website creator track.
  - [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/freegyes/codex-vitae). starting 'chest of projects' and 'beliefs' sections.
  - Holiday. spending an energizing week in Austria.
  - Ethics. reading about ethics.

## About /now page
The /now page is a reminder for myself when I'm feeling unfocused. A declaration of priorities. If I dedicate a significant amount of my resources to anything that is not listed here, I step back and ask myself if that thing should be listed here or dropped.
