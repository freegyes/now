This lists the projects and habits I'm currently working on. It's a reminder for myself when I'm feeling unfocused. A declaration of priorities <sup>[1](#footnote-01)</sup>.

## Projects
At this point in my life I am focused on these projects (in no particular order):
  - [CodeBerry](https://codeberryschool.com/). product development, fundraising, writing curriculum and selling top talents
  - [YearCompass](http://yearcompass.com/). updating press kit, establishing shop and delivering elegant edition.
  - [Codex Vitae](https://github.com/freegyes/codex-vitae). initiating.

## Habits
At this point in my life I am focused on these habits (in no particular order):
  - reading 15 minutes every day to learn more and just for the sake of reading
  - eating fresh fruit every day to help my body be healthy
  - writing [750 words](https://750words.com/) first thing in the morning to achieve greater clarity of thoughts
